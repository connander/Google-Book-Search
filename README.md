Seach to the page that lets you search up books, and save leads to the page of all your saved books.

On the Search page:
Type the book you want to look up in the text field and press submit. Then all the books that google brings
back will appear below. Each entry will give the name of the book, the author, and a short description,
as well as an image of the book. The view book button, leads to the google play store where you can purchase
a copy. The Save book button saves the book to the database.

On the Saved Book page:
All books saved appear and give the image, title, and short description of the book. You can use the delete
book button to remove from the list and the view book leads back to the google play page.
